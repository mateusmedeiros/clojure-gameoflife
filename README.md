# experimenting

A very small game of life implementation I did for learning purposes. Probably not a very good clojure example code if that's what you're looking for. I think I'm still too rooted on my Java class-oriented ways, I ended up making namespaces as if they were java classes in my head. Still, I tried to do the clojure way the most I could, as after all, this was for learning purposes. It would be worth nothing if I didn't go through the ways I want to learn.
